# Mustard Seed Community Farm

In 2019, Mustard Seed was worried about compaction issues on their farm. My lab has a sweet penetrometer, so I volunteered to get some data for them. 

### Penetrometer Measurements

We took readings on how hard the soil was to penetrate across 0-40cm depths. Readings were taken at various points in each field.

### Soil Tests

We soil sampled each field and sent it off for nutrient analyses. Alice is in charge of those results. Maybe theyâ€™ll go here someday.
