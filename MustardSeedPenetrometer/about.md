# Mustard Seed Community Farm

[Mustard Seed Community Farm](https://www.mustardseedfarm.org) is located in Ames Iowa. They provide volunteer opportunities and food for the community. 


In 2019, Mustard Seed was worried about compaction issues on their farm.

* My lab has a sweet penetrometer, so I volunteered to get some data for them. 

* We took readings on how hard the soil was to penetrate across 0-40cm depths. 

* Readings were taken at various points in each field. 

This web application will allow you to explore the data at your leisure.
